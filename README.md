# Work & Co Web Code Assessment

If you'd like to see all of my decision-making process please view the [planning.md](planning.md) file for more details.

This is a copy of the [Redux Shopping Cart Example](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/shopping-cart).

To install dependencies, use the package manager [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/):

```
yarn
```

To start a development server:

```
yarn start
```

## Setup

Please create a new, public Github repository where your assessment can be reviewed. We recommend the following steps:

- Create a repository on your personal Github. Make sure the `Initialize this repository with a README` box is unchecked.
- Visit your new repository. Copy the `â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line` code provided and run it in your terminal in the same directory as this README file. It will look something like this:

```
git remote add origin git@github.com:my-username/my-assessment.git
git push -u origin master
```

Note: You're encouraged to show your work by including multiple commits - we'll be looking through your git history.
